# Todo Project

This is a full-stack Todo application built with a Vue.js frontend and an Express.js backend. The app allows users to manage projects, tasks, and todos in a hierarchical structure. It features a responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI, and uses Pinia for state management on the frontend. The backend uses SQLite for data storage and follows an MVC pattern with validation powered by Yup. The API is documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.

## Features
- Project, task, and todo management with CRUD operations
- Hierarchical structure: Projects > Tasks > Todos
- Responsive, modern UI with theme switching (light/dark)
- Sidebar navigation for projects
- Filtering and sorting for tasks
- Validation on both frontend and backend
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the API
- CORS and request logging enabled on the backend
